Remember: for each new post you need to include the header. See the .md file in _posts for an example

Markdown is a syntax which allows you to easily format text in different ways. Jekyll will convert your markdown files to html. You'll learn to love markdown, or at least I hope so.

The above paragraph is writing without any formatting so it will appear as unformatted text. Just like this paragraph. However with markdown you can do a number of different things. Here are some examples. Note: these examples will make the most sense if you view the .md file for this post in your _posts directory.

# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3

**bold text**

*italicized text*

Here's an unordered list:
* item one 
* item two
* item three

Here's an ordered list:
1. item one
2. item two
3. item three

Finally, this is how you link:

Once you are comfortable with the material here. You may want to delete this post from your blog by deleting the .md file from the _posts directory.
