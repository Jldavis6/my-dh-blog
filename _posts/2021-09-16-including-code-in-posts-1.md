There are a few ways to include code in your posts. Remember to view this post both on the browser and in the .md file in your _posts directory to follow along.

One way to include code is to use 3 tick marks to set off the code block:

Input:
```
greeting = 'hello world!'
print(greeting)
```
Output:
```
hello world!
```

If you just want to show what a few lines of code look like, this is a quick and easy way to do so. However, this code cannot be executed here.

Once you are comfortable with the material here. You may want to delete this post from your blog by deleting the .md file from the _posts directory.
